Overlay
=================

**Overlay** is a *Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game* engine made with **Haxe**

## Usage

### Build

You'll need **Haxe** and the **random** haxe library.
```bash
haxelib install random # first run if you don't have it
haxe make.hxml # build
```

### Run

Run it with **Neko** (or other platform you can configure in `make.hxml`, as the project is currently platform independant)

```bash
neko bin/Overlay.n
```
